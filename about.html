<h1>Humble beginnings</h1>
<p>Bakecarry was an idea that arose during a very ordinary event. This idea was conceived during one of our interacions at MYC tech Academy. We noticed that sessions were dull with everyone focused on their own tasks. interactions were minimal. One Friday we baked some cookies and brought to class. Everyone seemed happy and this led to interactions among students and the instructors.Everyone loved the cookies and requested for more. We ended up spending more time baking more cookies and bringing them to class and this made the classes lively. </p>

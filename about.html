<p> Bakecarry was an idea that arose during a very ordinary event. This idea was conceived during our studies at MYC tech Academy. We noticed that sessions were dull with everyone focused on their own tasks. Interactions were minimal. One Friday we baked some cookies and brought to class. Everyone seemed happy and this led to interactions among students and the instructors.Everyone loved the cookies and requested for more. We ended up spending more time baking more cookies and bringing them to class. This exercise made us perfect our baking skills and it helped build our first customer base. Currently we are among the leading local suppliers in the baking industry.</p>
